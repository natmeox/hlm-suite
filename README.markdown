A set of integrated softcode programs for Fuzzball 6. Notable features are:

* Standard color feedback sigils for command messages defined in `macros.txt`.
* Management of per-program ignores through `lib-ignore`.
* Use of `page #alias` style aliases across many programs through `lib-alias`.
* Use of `page #away` style away marking across many programs through `lib-away`.
* Easy routines for displaying tabular data as in ws, wd, etc with `lib-table`.

These are MUF (MUCK Forth) programs that use TinyMUCK Fuzzball 6 features, and are provided under the MIT license.
